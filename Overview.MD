# In this project, I decided to create a simple REACT Native app that allows for users to keep track with their expenses based on users input expenses or income. I experiemnted with state hooks to help with current and dynamic data. Prior to the introduction of hooks in React, state could only be used in class components VIA DOMS manipulations. Now, Bby using the useState hook, we can manage the state of a functional component in a way that's similar to how we would manage state in a class component. State of a component can be updated and reflected state over time as the user interacts with the application or as the application receives new data overtime. This helped me understand the basic fundamentals of using state hooks to handle users input and data for future state changes effectively.


# Type in a description to add or remove expenses from income. You can also remove balances in the app to add onto your income.
